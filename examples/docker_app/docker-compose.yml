#### This docker-compose.yml file tells Docker to do the following:
# 1. Pull the image we uploaded in step 2 from the registry.
# 2. Run 5 instances of that image as a service called web, limiting each one to use, at most, 10% of a single core of CPU time (this could also be e.g. “1.5” to mean 1 and half core for each), and 50MB of RAM.
# 3. Immediately restart containers if one fails.
# 4. Map port 4000 on the host to web’s port 80.
# 5. Instruct web’s containers to share port 80 via a load-balanced network called webnet. (Internally, the containers themselves publish to web’s port 80 at an ephemeral port.)
# 6. Define the webnet network with the default settings (which is a load-balanced overlay network).
